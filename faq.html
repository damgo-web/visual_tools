    <dl><dt id="1"><strong>What is a carpenter?</strong></dt>
        <dd>The word “carpenter” is the English rendering of the Old French word carpentier (later, charpentier) which is derived from the Latin carpentarius [artifex], “(maker) of a carriage.</dd>
		<dd>Carpenter is a person who makes and repairs wooden objects and structures. Carpenters traditionally worked with natural wood and did the rougher work such as framing, but today many other materials are also used and sometimes the finer trades of cabinetmaking and furniture building are considered carpentry.</dd>
